        <h2 class="topic">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="exp">Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph 
            wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.
            It takes more than a camera to be a good photographer. But with today's smart technology, it's easier than ever to learn how to take great pictures. 
            This course, designed strictly for beginners, provides for a solid grounding in the skills and tools you'll need to explore the world of digital photography.
            The path to becoming a better photographer begins with the first step.

            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/02/29/15/49/abstract-19175_1280.jpg" alt="Eye">
        </div>
        <p class="exp">
            Our eyes are able to look around a scene and dynamically adjust based on subject matter, whereas cameras 
            a single still image. This trait accounts for many of our commonly understood advantages over cameras. 
            For example, our eyes can compensate as we focus on regions of varying brightness, can look around to encompass a 
            broader angle of view, or can alternately focus on objects at a variety of distances.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Angle of view</h3>
        <p class="exp">With cameras, this is determined by the focal length of the lens (along with the sensor size of the camera).
            Unfortunately our eyes aren't as straightforward. Although the human eye has a focal length of approximately 22 mm, this is misleading because 
            (i) the back of our eyes are curved, 
            (ii) the periphery of our visual field contains progressively less detail than the center
            (iii) the scene we perceive is the combined result of both eyes.
            Each eye individually has anywhere from a 120-200° angle of view, depending on how strictly one defines objects as being "seen." Similarly, 
            the dual eye overlap region is around 130° — or nearly as wide as a fisheye lens. However, for evolutionary reasons our extreme peripheral 
            vision is only useful for sensing motion and large-scale objects (such as a lion pouncing from your side). Furthermore, 
            such a wide angle would appear highly distorted and unnatural if it were captured by a camera.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Resolution and details</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            At 20/20 vision, the human eye is able to resolve the equivalent of a 52 megapixel camera 
            (assuming a 60° angle of view).However, such calculations are misleading. Only our central vision is 20/20, so 
            we never actually resolve that much detail in a single glance. Away from the center, our visual ability decreases dramatically,
             such that by just 20° off-center our eyes resolve only one-tenth as much detail. 
            </p>
            <h3>3. Sensitivity and dynamic range</h3>
            <p class="exp">
                Dynamic range is one area where the eye is often seen as having a huge advantage. If we were to consider situations 
                where our pupil opens and closes for different brightness regions, then yes, our eyes far surpass the 
                capabilities of a single camera image.our eye's dynamic range also depends on brightness and subject contrast, 
                so the above only applies to typical daylight conditions. 
                With low-light star viewing our eyes can approach an even higher instantaneous dynamic range.
                Sensitivity. This is another important visual characteristic, and describes the ability to resolve very faint or fast-moving subjects. 
                During bright light, modern cameras are better at resolving fast moving subjects, as exemplified by unusual-looking high-speed photography. 
                This is often made possible by camera ISO speeds exceeding 3200; the equivalent daylight ISO for the human eye is even thought to be as low as 1.

                However, under low-light conditions, our eyes become much more sensitive (presuming that we let them adjust for 30+ minutes).
                Astrophotographers often estimate this as being near ISO 500-1000; still not as high as digital cameras, but close. On the other hand,
                cameras have the advantage of being able to take longer exposures to bring out even fainter objects, whereas our eyes don't see additional 
                detail after staring at something for more than about 10-15 seconds.

        <h2 class="topic">Holding the camera</h2>
        <p class="exp">
        One of the common problems that many new digital (and film) photographers have is ‘camera shake’ where images seem blurry – usually 
        because the camera was not held still enough while the shutter was depressed. This is especially common in shots taken in low light 
        situations where the shutter is open for longer periods of time. Even the smallest movement of the camera can cause it and the only 
        real way to eliminate it is with a tripod.
        Adding to camera shake is a technique that is increasingly common with digital camera users of holding the camera at arms length away 
        from them as they take shots – often with one hand. While this might be a good way to frame your shot the further away from your body 
        (a fairly stable thing) you hold a camera the more chance you have of swaying or shaking as you take your shot.
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/05/12/21/24/dslr-2308202_1280.jpg" alt="Holding the camera">
        <h3>How to hold the camera ?</h3>
        <p class="exp"><b>Use your right hand to grip the right hand end of the camera.</b> Your forefinger should sit lightly above the shutter release, 
               your other three fingers curling around the front of the camera. Your right thumb grips onto the back of the camera.
               Most cameras these days have some sort of grip and even impressions for where fingers should go so this should feel natural. Use 
               a strong grip with your right hand but don’t grip it so tightly that you end up shaking the camera. (keep in mind our previous post 
               on shutter technique – squeeze the shutter don’t jab at it).<br>
           <b>The positioning of your left hand will depend upon</b>your camera but in in general it should support the weight of the camera and
               will either sit underneath the camera or under/around a lens if you have a DSLR.<br>
           <b>If you’re shooting using the view finder </b>to line up your shot you’ll have the camera nice and close into your body which will 
               add extra stability but if you’re using the LCD make sure you don’t hold your camera too far away from you. Tuck your elbows into your
               sides and lean the camera out a little from your face (around 30cm). Alternatively use the viewfinder if it’s not too small or difficult 
               to see through (a problem on many point and shoots these days).<br>
           <b>Add extra stability by leaning against a solid object</b> like a wall or a tree or by sitting or kneeling down. If you have to stand 
               and don’t have anything to lean on for extra support put your feet shoulder width apart to give yourself a steady stance. The stiller you 
               can keep your body the stiller the camera will be.</p>

        <p class="exp">
            A photograph's exposure determines how light or dark an image will appear when it's been captured by your camera. Believe it or not, this is 
            determined by just three camera settings: aperture, ISO and shutter speed (the "exposure triangle"). Mastering their use is an essential part of 
            developing an intuition for photography.
            Setting the right exposure on your camera can make a big difference in how your photographs turn out.
            Most digital cameras have one of the following standardized exposure modes: Auto,Program (P), Aperture Priority (Av), Shutter Priority (Tv), Manual (M) 
            and Bulb (B) mode. Av, Tv, and M are often called "creative modes" or "auto exposure (AE) modes."

        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/02/25/00/13/iris-aperture-274025_1280.jpg" alt="Aperature">
       <p class="exp"> Aperture is the opening in the camera lens. A larger hole allows more light to hit the sensor, lightening your photos. A smaller hole allows 
           less light to hit the sensor, darkening your photos. And by adjusting the aperture setting on your camera, you can adjust the size of the aperture 
           (and, in turn affect a photo’s brightness).<br>
           It is specified in terms of an f-stop value, which can at times be counterintuitive, because the area of the opening increases as the f-stop decreases.
           Every time the f-stop value halves, the light-collecting area quadruples. There's a formula for this, but most photographers just memorize the f-stop 
           numbers that correspond to each doubling/halving of light:

        <h2 class="topic">Shutter speed</h2>
        <p class="exp">
            A camera's shutter determines when the camera sensor will be open or closed to incoming light from the camera lens. 
            The shutter speed specifically refers to how long this light is permitted to enter the camera. "Shutter speed" and 
            "exposure time" refer to the same concept, where a faster shutter speed means a shorter exposure time.
            Shutter speed's influence on exposure is perhaps the simplest of the three camera settings: it correlates exactly 
            1:1 with the amount of light entering the camera.

        <h2 class="topic">ISO</h2>
        <p class="exp">
            ISO refers to your camera’s sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive your camera sensor becomes, 
            and the brighter your photos appear.
            ISO is measured in numbers. Here are a few standard ISO values: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200.
            The "normal" range of camera ISO is about 200 to 1600. With today's digital cameras you can sometimes go as low as 50 or as high 
            as over three million, depending upon the camera model. The number chosen has two important qualities associated with it. First, 
            it sets the amount of light needed for a good exposure. The lower the number, the more light required. The more light that's required, 
            the more likely a slow shutter speed will have to be used. That means low ISOs, like 100 or 200, are most often used in bright situations (like sunlight) 
            or when the camera is mounted on a tripod. If you don't have a lot of light, or need a fast shutter speed, you would probably raise the ISO.
        </p>
        <h3>Effects of increasing ISO</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            Each time you double the ISO (for example, from 200 to 400), the camera needs only half as much light for the same exposure. So if you had a shutter speed of 
            1/250 at 200 ISO, going to 400 ISO would let you get the same exposure at 1/500 second (providing the aperture remains unchanged). This is why high ISOs are so 
            often used indoors, especially at sporting events. Needing a fast shutter speed to stop action, photographers regularly choose ISO 1600 or above.
        </p>
        <h3>ISO amd Image Noise</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            The other important quality tied to ISO is the amount of noise in the image. In the days of film, as you used film with higher ISO values (often referred to as ASA then), 
            your images had more visible grain. Film grain is what made up the image, and higher numbers resulted in larger grain, which was more obvious. Most people found visible grain
            objectionable and so photographers worked to avoid it when possible.
            In digital cameras, raising the ISO means a similar decrease in quality, with an increase in what's called "noise." It's the digital equivalent of grain and results in a sort of
             "chunky" look to the image.
        </p>
        <h3>What is auto ISO ?</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            Auto ISO was introduced into digital cameras several years ago to help photographers manage noise balance. Turning on that feature allows the camera to push the ISO up when it decides the 
            shutter speed is getting too low for a good picture
        </p>

        <h2 class="topic">Understanding Histograms</h2>
        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8508/8443818492_4a8521a22e.jpg" alt="Histogram">
       <p class="exp">A histogram is a graphical representation of the pixels in your image. The left side of the graph represents the blacks or shadows, the right side represents the highlights or bright areas, 
        and the middle section represents the midtones (middle or 18% gray). 
        The heights of the peaks represent the number of pixels of a particular tone (with each peak corresponding to a different tone). Each tone from 0-255 (0 being black and 255 being white) is one pixel 
        wide on the graph, so imagine the histogram as a bar graph all squished together with no spaces between each bar.
        <br>There are many things we can learn about an image just by looking at its histogram.
        </p>
        <h3>When the histogram tells you to adjust your exposure</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            Gaps on either end indicate you are missing information and your exposure can be shifted safely without losing detail. When your graph is shifted too far in one direction or the other direction, 
            so that it does not even touch the other edge, you can safely shift your exposure to cover more of the range of tones.
        </p>
        <h3>What do the spikes up the sides mean?</h3>
        <p class="exp">
        Spikes up the left or right edge of the histogram indicate “clipping” of that tone and a loss of detail in that area. Clipped areas are often unrecoverable, especially in the highlights.

        It is generally advised to expose so that your graph just touches the right edge (which indicates that you’ve kept your highlight details). It is usually easier to recover some shadow detail and retain a decent 
        image than to try and create highlight detail that isn’t in the file.

        <h2 class="topic">Depth of field</h2>
        <p class="exp">Depth of field (DoF) is one of the most important concepts in photography. Understanding what DoF is, and knowing what factors affect it, 
            are things all photographers should master.<br>
                <b>Depth of field</b> is the distance between the closest and farthest objects in a photo that appears acceptably sharp. Now your camera can 
                only focus sharply at one point. But the transition from sharp to unsharp is gradual, and the term ‘acceptably sharp’ is a loose one! 
                Without getting too technical, how you will be viewing the image, and at what size you will be looking at it are factors that contribute 
                to how acceptably sharp an image is. It also depends on how good your vision is!

            <p class="exp">The distance between the camera and the subject.
                The shorter that distance, the smaller the depth of field.
                 <br>Focal length of the lens,
                Wide-angle lenses (short focal lengths) have a deeper depth of field than telephoto lenses (long focal lengths).
            <br>Sensor size,
                Cameras with smaller sensors have larger depths of field.
                However, you have to be careful how you make the comparison. You must look at cameras with lenses that have the same effective focal 
                length so that the fields of view are the same. If you shoot at the same camera-subject distance, with the same apertures, you will find 
                that the larger sensors have a shallower DoF. 
                That is why many professional portrait photographers like to use full frame cameras.

        <h2 class="topic">White Balance</h2>
        <p class="exp">White balance (WB) is the process of removing unrealistic color casts, so that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your photo. 
            Proper camera white balance has to take into account the "color temperature" of a light source, which refers to the relative warmth or coolness of white light. 
            Our eyes are very good at judging what is white under different light sources, but digital cameras often have great difficulty with auto white balance (AWB) — 
            and can create unsightly blue, orange, or even green color casts. Understanding digital white balance can help you avoid these color casts, thereby improving your 
            photos under a wider range of lighting conditions.Most cameras come with the option to manually set or adjust white balance. Typical settings include “sun”, “shade”, 
            “tungsten” and “fluorescent”. Some cameras come with the option to manually set a color temperature by choosing a specific Kelvin value.

        <h2 class="topic">Focal length</h2>
        <p class="exp">The focal length of a lens is an optical property of the lens. It measures the distance, in millimetres, 
            between the optical centre of the lens and the camera’s sensor (or film plane). It is determined with 
            the camera focused to infinity. Lenses are named by their focal length, and you can find this information on the barrel of the lens.
            Focal length is a property of the lens itself, not the camera. <br>
            While the definition of focal length may be relevant to some people, as photographers, it is not something you need to remember. 
            What is more important to understand is what focal length tells us. Focal length describes the angle of view of a lens. That is,
             how much of a scene before us the lens captures. And in addition, how large subjects within the frame appear. The longer the focal 
             length of a lens, the narrower its angle of view. Subjects appear larger using long focal length lenses than they do viewing them with our eyes. 
             On the other hand, lenses with short focal lengths take in a much wider angle of view. Thus, elements seem much smaller in the frame than they do to our eye.

        <p class="exp">A polarizing filter is one of the most essential tools in a photographer’s bag. It is typically the first filter landscape photographers buy to instantly 
            improve their pictures by adding vividness and contrast to them. Putting a polarizing filter on your lens is like wearing a pair of polarized sunglasses 
            over your eyes – the polarized glass blocks random light waves from passing through, creating a clearer image.

        <h2 class="topic">Balance</h2>
        <p class="exp">Balance is one of the least-discussed principles of good composition, but it is perhaps the most important. Photographers, consciously or not, make an important 
            decision for every image: should the composition be balanced or imbalanced? To some degree, every photograph in existence has elements of both balance and imbalance, 
            which makes this topic crucial for photographers looking to improve the strength of their images at the most fundamental level.
        </p>
        <h3>Left-Right Balance</h3>
        <p class="exp">When a photo is perfectly balanced, it means that the left and right halves of the photo draw the eye equally.</p>
        <h3>Balance vs Imbalance</h3>
        <p class="exp">Balance, or a lack of it, inherently makes your images appear more or less serene. With a balanced image, the frame is more calm than one which skews visual attention 
           to one side or the other. 
        </p>
        <h3>Symmetry</h3>
        <p class="exp">The most obvious type of balance is one in which the image is identical on the left and right halves. Perfect, pixel-level symmetry is not possible outside of computer-generated 
            images, but a nearly-symmetrical photo is more than enough for us to notice a balanced composition.
        </p>
        <h3>Asymmetrical Balance</h3>
        <p class="exp">
            A photo does not have to be symmetrical to be balanced.For an image to be balanced, each side must call for the same level of attention from a viewer.

            <li>Areas of contrast</li>
            <li>Items that are in focus (especially if most of the photo is not)</li>
            <li>Bright spots</li>

            <li>The eyes of your subject</li>
            <li>The direction that your subject is looking (even if it is an empty space, it gains visual weight because viewers will want to look the same direction as the subject)</li>
